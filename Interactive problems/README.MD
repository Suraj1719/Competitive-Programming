Interactive problems are basically very interesting part of programming they are easy to approach.

# format to solve interactive problems :
    
      data_type Query_Fucntion(arguments){
          cout<<"? "<<arguments;
          data_type in;
          cin>>in;
          return in;
      }
      
      
 
by using above function you can ask queries. 
    
Always look for maximum queries and constraint you may get a hint from there how to approach problem.
In CF round interactive problems almost every time rated above 1800 and if you know about interactive problems and think a little bit and code it smoothly you will get AC.
